# OO Relations

### steps:

1. Figure out **classes** 

2. **Relationship**

3. **Attributes** for classes

4. Create classes with initialize method

5. **TEST** your **CODE**

6. **attr_macros** (attr_reader/attr_wrirter/attr_accessor)

7. Create **class variable** (@@all) and **class method** (.all)

8. **TEST** your **CODE**

9. **one-many:**
   From the "one" classes, create a method to get all of the "many" instances that belong to that instance

   **OR**
 
   **many-many:**
   From the "many" classes, create a method to get all of the "joiner" class instances that belong to that instance 

10. **TEST** your **CODE**

11. (**Only for many-many**) From the "many" classes, create a method to get all of the other "many" instances that belong to that instance

12. **TEST** your **CODE**

13. Check the Deliverables 

***

## customer
- Customer.new() should create a new customer with a name 

- Customer#name should work

- Customer#banks should return all banks that are associated with the customer

- Customer#balance should return total balance from all the accounts from all the bank that are associated with the customer

## bank
- Bank.new() should create a new bank with a name

- Bank#name should work

- Bank.all should return all bank instances

- Bank#accounts should return all accounts that belong to the bank

- Bank#customers should return all of the customers that are associated with the bank

- Bank#open_account takes customer instance as an argument and create a new account with 100 as an initial balance

## account
